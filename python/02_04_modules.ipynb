As your project grows, it will become more and more awkward to do this, it is difficult to find anything in a single code file, and you may eventually run into a problem if you want to call two different classes by the same name. At some point it will be a good idea to tidy up the project by splitting it into several files, grouping the associated classes or functions in the same file.\n","\n","Sometimes there will be a natural way to split things up at the start of the project.
