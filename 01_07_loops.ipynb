The group of instructions that are executed over and over again is called a loop. There are two loop statements in Python: `for` and `while`. We will discuss the difference between these statements later in the chapter, but first let's look at a real-world example of a loop.\n","\n","\n","An employee of a petrol station performs the following actions when serving a customer:\n","\n"," - 1) Greet the customer\n"," - 2) Ask for the type and quantity of petrol required\n"," - 3) Ask if the customer needs other services\n"," - 4) Ask for the amount of money required\n"," - 5) Give money to the cashier\n"," - 6) Wait for change and receipt\n"," - 7) Give change and receipt to the customer\n"," - 8) Say thank you and goodbye\n","\n","The employee performs these steps for each customer, but does not follow them when there is no customer to serve. He also only performs them when he is working. If we were to write a computer program to simulate this behaviour, it would not be enough to provide the steps and ask the computer to repeat them over and over again. We would also need to tell it when to stop running them.\n","\n","There are two main types of programming loops: counting loops (`for`) and event-controlled loops (`while`).\n","\n","In a counting loop, the computer knows at the beginning of the loop execution how many times it has to execute the loop. In Python, this type of loop is defined with the `for` statement, which executes the body of the loop for each element in a list.\n","\n","In an event-controlled loop, the computer stops the execution of the loop when a condition is no longer true. In Python, you can use the `while` statement. The computer executes the body of the loop as long as the condition is true. The `while` statement checks the condition before performing each iteration of the loop.\n","\n","The counting loops are actually a subset of the event control loop, the loop is repeated until the required number of iterations is reached.\n","\n","If you wanted to go from Paris to Marseille, which loop algorithm would you use? If you started by putting your car on the road to Marseille, you could :\n","\n","- Drive exactly 7.30 am. After 7:30, stop the car and get out.\n","- Drive exactly 780km. After 780km, stop the car and get out.\n","- Drive until we arrive in Marseille. Once there, stop the car and get off.\n","\n","The first two algorithms are based on counting, neither of which guarantees that you will arrive in Marseille. In the first case, you might encounter heavy traffic or no traffic at all, and not reach or pass your desired destination. In the second case, you may find a diversion and end up far from Camps Bay.\n","\n","The third algorithm is event-driven. You keep driving as long as you are not in Marseille. The condition you keep checking is: have I arrived in Marseille?\n","\n","## 1. The loop `while`\n","\n","The Python statement for an event-controlled loop is: `while`. You should use it when you don't know in advance how many times you should execute the loop body. As long as the condition is true, the `while` body keeps repeating.

You first initialise this number to 1. In the condition, you check whether `i` is less than or equal to 10, and if it is, you execute the loop body. Then, at the end of the loop body, you update `i` by incrementing it by 1.\n","\n","It is very important that you increment `i` at the end. Otherwise, `i` would always be 1, the condition would always be true and your program would never end. We call this an infinite loop.
