However, if the data set in your `DataFrame` has 60,000 rows and 400 columns, how do you even begin to get a sense of what you're working with? Fortunately, pandas provides some convenient tools to quickly look at overall information about a `DataFrame` in addition to the first few and last few rows.\n","\n","In order to explore this functionality, we will import the Python scikit-learn library and use an iconic dataset that every data scientist has seen hundreds of times: British biologist Ronald Fisher's *Iris* data set.\n","\n","The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"id":"hB1RofhdgRrp","trusted":false,"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1657275010695,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"na li","userId":"09447721022410954112"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":204},"outputId":"b7ad3968-6a91-4245-8eeb-0a2947325bec"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["   sepal length (cm)  sepal width (cm)  petal length (cm)  petal width (cm)\n","0                5.1               3.5                1.4               0.2\n","1                4.9               3.0                1.4               0.2\n","2                4.7               3.2                1.3               0.2\n","3                4.6               3.1                1.5               0.2\n","4                5.0               3.6                1.4               0.2"],"text/html":["\n","  <div id=\"df-11d47508-f644-4fbb-b49a-75f70e23133c\">\n","    <div class=\"colab-df-container\">\n","      <div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>sepal length (cm)</th>\n","      <th>sepal width (cm)</th>\n","      <th>petal length (cm)</th>\n","      <th>petal width (cm)</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>5.1</td>\n","      <td>3.5</td>\n","      <td>1.4</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>4.9</td>\n","      <td>3.0</td>\n","      <td>1.4</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>4.7</td>\n","      <td>3.2</td>\n","      <td>1.3</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>4.6</td>\n","      <td>3.1</td>\n","      <td>1.5</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>5.0</td>\n","      <td>3.6</td>\n","      <td>1.4</td>\n","      <td>0.2</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>\n","      <button class=\"colab-df-convert\" onclick=\"convertToInteractive('df-11d47508-f644-4fbb-b49a-75f70e23133c')\"\n","              title=\"Convert this dataframe to an interactive table.\"\n","              style=\"display:none;\">\n","        \n","  <svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" height=\"24px\"viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\"\n","       width=\"24px\">\n","    <path d=\"M0 0h24v24H0V0z\" fill=\"none\"/>\n","    <path d=\"M18.56 5.44l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm-11 1L8.5 8.5l.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94L8.5 2.5l-.94 2.06-2.06.94zm10 10l.94 2.06.94-2.06 2.06-.94-2.06-.94-.94-2.06-.94 2.06-2.06.94z\"/><path d=\"M17.41 7.96l-1.37-1.37c-.4-.4-.92-.59-1.43-.59-.52 0-1.04.2-1.43.59L10.3 9.45l-7.72 7.72c-.78.78-.78 2.05 0 2.83L4 21.41c.39.39.9.59 1.41.59.51 0 1.02-.2 1.41-.59l7.78-7.78 2.81-2.81c.8-.78.8-2.07 0-2.86zM5.41 20L4 18.59l7.72-7.72 1.47 1.35L5.41 20z\"/>\n","  </svg>\n","      </button>\n","      \n","  <style>\n","    .colab-df-container {\n","      display:flex;\n","      flex-wrap:wrap;\n","      gap: 12px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #E8F0FE;\n","      border: none;\n","      border-radius: 50%;\n","      cursor: pointer;\n","      display: none;\n","      fill: #1967D2;\n","      height: 32px;\n","      padding: 0 0 0 0;\n","      width: 32px;\n","    }\n","\n","    .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #E2EBFA;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 2px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.3), 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(60, 64, 67, 0.15);\n","      fill: #174EA6;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert {\n","      background-color: #3B4455;\n","      fill: #D2E3FC;\n","    }\n","\n","    [theme=dark] .colab-df-convert:hover {\n","      background-color: #434B5C;\n","      box-shadow: 0px 1px 3px 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);\n","      filter: drop-shadow(0px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3));\n","      fill: #FFFFFF;\n","    }\n","  </style>\n","\n","      <script>\n","        const buttonEl =\n","          document.querySelector('#df-11d47508-f644-4fbb-b49a-75f70e23133c button.colab-df-convert');\n","        buttonEl.style.display =\n","          google.colab.kernel.accessAllowed ?
