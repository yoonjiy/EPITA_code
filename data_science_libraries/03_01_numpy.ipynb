Introduction\n","\n","The main object of NumPy is the homogeneous multidimensional array. It is an array of elements (usually numbers), all of the `same type', indexed by a tuple of non-negative integers. In NumPy, the dimensions are called `axes`.\n","\n","For example, the coordinates of a point in 3D space `[1, 2, 1]` have an axis. This axis contains 3 elements, so we say it has a length of 3.\n","In the example shown below, the array has 2 axes. The first axis has a length of 2, the second axis has a length of 3.\n","\n","```\n","[[1., 0., 0.],\n"," [0., 1., 2.]]\n","```\n","\n","The class of a NumPy array is called `ndarray`. It is also known by the alias: `array`.\n","\n","The most important attributes of an endarray object are :\n","\n","| Method | Description |\n","| ------- | ----------- |\n","| `ndarray.ndim` | the number of axes (dimensions) in the table. |\n","| `ndarray.shape` | the dimensions of the array. This is a tuple of integers indicating the size of the array in each dimension. For a matrix with `n` rows and `m` columns, the `shape` will be `(n,m)`. The length of the shape tuple is therefore the number of axes, `ndim`. |\n","| `ndarray.size` | the total number of elements in the array. This is equal to the product of the elements of `shape`. |\n","| `ndarray.dtype` | an object describing the type of the elements in the array. You can create or specify dtypes using standard Python types. In addition, NumPy provides its own types. `numpy.int32`, `numpy.int16` and `numpy.float64` are some examples. |\n","| `ndarray.itemsize` | the size in bytes of each element of the array. For example, an array of elements of type `float64` has an `itemsize` of 8 (=64/8), while one of type complex32 has an element size of 4 (=32/8). It is equivalent to `ndarray.dtype.itemsize`. |\n","| `ndarray.data` | the buffer containing the actual elements of the array. Normally we will not need to use this attribute as we will access the elements of an array using indexing functions. |\n","\n","Some examples: "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"UFD__PlhUVMB","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1657109986407,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Na LI","userId":"12754296058413970077"}},"outputId":"8e609ab4-d71c-4d53-d9bf-ebc591ac3cde"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["[[ 0  1  2  3  4]\n"," [ 5  6  7  8  9]\n"," [10 11 12 13 14]]\n","(3, 5)\n","2\n","int64\n","8\n","15\n","<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n","[6 7 8]\n","<class 'numpy.ndarray'>\n"]}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","# Generate 2 dimensions array\n","a = np.arange(15).reshape(3, 5)\n","print(a)\n","\n","# Show infos\n","print(a.shape)\n","print(a.ndim)\n","print(a.dtype.name)\n","print(a.itemsize)\n","print(a.size)\n","print(type(a))\n","\n","\n","# Create 1 dimension array\n","b = np.array([6, 7, 8])\n","print(b)\n","print(type(b))\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"_5Xhkc0NUVMC"},"source":["## 2.
